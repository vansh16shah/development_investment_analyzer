AI Project Evaluation Tool Documentation

Overview

The AI Project Evaluation Tool is a powerful, interactive, web-based tool that assists decision-makers in evaluating the potential return on investment (ROI) of proposed AI projects. It calculates a project's net gain and time-adjusted gain based on several input parameters. The tool is implemented using the Streamlit framework in Python, offering a smooth user interface with sidebar sliders for easy manipulation of input parameters.

Key Features

Multiple Input Parameters: Customize the evaluation based on various factors, such as expected project value, risk of failure, cost, expected revenue, strategic alignment, availability of resources, and more.

Net Gain Calculation: Calculates the net gain (G) from the AI project based on the input parameters.

Time-adjusted Gain Calculation: Calculates the time-adjusted gain (G'), offering a measure of return accounting for the time to build the tool.

Sensitivity Analysis: Understand how sensitive the net gain is to changes in each input variable.

Monte Carlo Simulation: Run multiple simulations with random variations in each input variable to generate a distribution of possible outcomes.

Scorecard: Evaluates the project based on calculated gains and displays a scorecard categorizing the project as Good, Moderate, or Poor.

Interpretation of Results: Provides a qualitative interpretation of the results based on calculated gains.

How to Use
Clone or download the source code for this tool.
Ensure that the necessary Python libraries are installed, including Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
Run the application using the command streamlit run <app_filename.py>.
Adjust the sliders in the sidebar to reflect the parameters of your AI project.
The tool will automatically calculate and display the net gain, time-adjusted gain, and other results based on your inputs.
Interpret the results and make informed decisions about your AI project.

Future Enhancements
Scenario Analysis: This will allow users to define different scenarios (e.g., best case, worst case, most likely case) and see how they affect the results.

Risk Analysis: This will let users define different levels of risk tolerance and see how they affect the decision to build or hold.
